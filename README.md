# Eclipse-Dawn
Eclipse &amp; Dawn is a turn-based strategy game built around a dynamic day–night cycle where the battlefield itself changes power. Every few turns, the world shifts between Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night, and Eclipse- altering how units move, attack, and control space. Winning is not just about positioning, but timing your aggression with the cycle
