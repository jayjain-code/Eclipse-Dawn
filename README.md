# Eclipse & Dawn ☀️🌙

**Eclipse & Dawn** is a turn-based strategy game built around a **dynamic day–night cycle** where the battlefield itself changes power.

Every few turns, the world shifts between **Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night, and Eclipse** — altering how units move, attack, and control space.  
Winning is not just about positioning, but **timing your aggression with the cycle**.

## 🧠 Core Concept

- Two asymmetric factions:
  - **Solari (Sun-aligned)**
  - **Lunari (Moon-aligned)**
- A global **phase cycle** that buffs or weakens factions
- Tactical movement inspired by chess-like patterns
- Short, tense matches focused on foresight and tempo

---

## 🌗 The Phase Cycle

The game progresses through repeating celestial phases:

- **Dawn** 🌅 – Neutral balance
- **Day** ☀️ – Solari units gain range, Lunari weakened
- **Dusk** 🌇 – Neutral balance
- **Night** 🌙 – Lunari units gain range, Solari weakened
- **Eclipse** 🌑 – Chaos phase: both sides fight at maximum power

Mastering *when* to strike is just as important as *where*.
